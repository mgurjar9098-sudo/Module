1. Operating Systems:
C is one of the most important languages used to build operating systems.
How C is used:
The core parts of operating systems like Linux, Windows, and macOS are written in C.
C allows direct access to hardware (CPU, memory, disk), which is required for system-level programming.

Real-world examples:

Linux Kernel – almost entirely written in C
Windows OS – many low-level components use C
macOS – built using C and C-based languages

Why C is suitable:
Fast execution speed
Efficient memory management
Close interaction with hardware

2. Embedded Systems
Embedded systems are small computers built into devices to perform specific tasks.

How C is used:

C is used to program microcontrollers that control hardware components.
It helps in writing firmware that runs devices with limited memory and processing power.
Real-world examples:
Washing machines (control timers and motors)
Automobiles (engine control units, airbags)
Medical devices (heart monitors, infusion pumps)

Why C is suitable:
Requires less memory
High performance
Can directly control hardware registers

3. Game Development:
C is widely used in game engines and performance-critical game components.

How C is used:
Game engines use C for handling graphics, physics, and sound systems.
Many older and modern games rely on C-based engines.

Real-world examples:
Unity game engine (core components in C/C++)
Unreal Engine (uses C/C++)
Classic games like Doom were written in C

Why C is suitable:
High speed for real-time performance
Efficient memory usage
Better control over system resources
